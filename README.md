The goal of this documentation is to help you become a productive Python developer.

It assumes that those skills will be used in a professional environment. It includes concrete exercises, because the best way to learn is by doing. It focuses on real-world, applied documentation that will help your programming on a day-to-day basis.

This doc assumes programming knowledge and experience.

If you're also interested in generic programming best practices, I've compiled a list of [professional programming](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming) resources.

## Learning the language

## Writing idiomatic Python

First things first, let's get **code style** out of the way. Make sure you've read and memorized [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (code style, [more readable version here](http://pep8.org/)) and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) (docstring style). Those two code styles are applied by almost all major Python applications and libraries. Use flake8, pydocstyle and black to ensure they are applied (check other linters and autofixers below).

What is called "idiomatic Python" might feel magical at first, especially if you don't know Python. I'd recommend getting your hands dirty with some real world Python code. Try to wander around the code, opening random files. Run the tutorial with a debugger to follow the flow and understand what's going on.

- [bottle.py](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py): bottle is a web framework. It's a great resource because it's in all in whole file!
  Recommended reading. You can even print it.
- [flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask): another web framework, one of the best. Reading its code is highly recommended as well.

You can find other ideas on [this hacker news thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9896369).

I feel it's more important to understand the vision behind Python's design, than to know specific Python idioms. The Zen of Python will help you understand the fundamental reasoning behind each idiom.

```
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

- [3 Tips For Writing Pythonic Code](https://davidamos.dev/3-tips-for-writing-pythonic-code/)

List of books:

- [Awesome Python Books](https://github.com/Junnplus/awesome-python-books)

## Exercises

The best way to learn is to do.

### Code practice websites

- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)
- [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/start)
- Solve some of the [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

### Small exercises

- Create a virtual environment with `virtualenv`.
- Fix a bug in one of the Python packages listed in [the Python guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/#scenario-guide).
- Take inspiration from this [list of Raspberry Pi projects on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4e59wb/what_have_you_done_with_python_and_raspberry_pi/)

### Larger projects

- Build a lock library for Redis.
- Build a cache library for Redis.
- Build an API for storing todos
- Build an API for next bus departure time.
- Build an ORM for a SQL database.
- Build a command line parser.
- Build a template engine.
- Build a static site generator.
- Build an HTTP library.
- Clone one of those [games](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/)
- Write a game using [pyarcade](https://arcade.academy/)
- [spandanb/learndb-py](https://github.com/spandanb/learndb-py): learn database internals by implementing it from scratch.

Reddit's [dailyprogrammer subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)
has some good exercises as well.

Another great way to learn Python is by contributing to one of the numerous open source libraries. Coding is not something that is to be learn in isolation, and you'll learn great valuable insights from the code review you'll get from those communities. You can look for tickets (e.g. Github issues) for Python libraries you're using, or find some in the list below, or pick one of the libraries listed in [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).

Make sure you pick a library where the tickets are not too involved, and where the community is still alive (i.e. there's recent merged pull requests).

### SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is the de facto standard ORM for Python. It has a unique approach: contrary to most ORM, it tries very hard not to hide the SQL implementation details from you. This is great because it forces you to really understand the underlying DB.

Here is some slightly outdated content that is super useful to fully leverage the library:

- Watch the [SQLAlchemy introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO7FFPNvX2s&ab_channel=SixFeetUpCorp). It lasts 3 hours but is extremely insightful, and introduces to some great object oriented patterns.
- [Handcoded application with SQLAlchemy](http://pyvideo.org/video/665/hand-coded-applications-with-sqlalchemy)
- [Alembic](http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a lightweight database migration tool for usage with the SQLAlchemy Database Toolkit for Python.

### Tests

Half of coding time is usually spent writing tests. Yet how to write tests efficiently is very rarely taught at school - even though it came make a huge difference in engineering productivity and quality.

First, make sure you're familiar with the different kind of testing strategies laid out in [Testing Strategies in a Microservices Architecture](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) (Martin Fowler).

Then, read some of those articles:

- [Mock yourself, not your tests](http://hernantz.github.io/mock-yourself-not-your-tests.html): great articles about the danger of mocking, and better unit testing strategies.
- [Building Good Tests](https://salmonmode.github.io//2019/03/29/building-good-tests.html), Chris NeJame
  - 1 assert per test function/method and nothing else
  - Use standard assert statements, instead of the unittest.TestCase assert methods
  - Test behavior, not implementation
  - Only verify state-changing method calls
  - Test the result, not the process
  - Every test should be able to be run in parallel with any other test
  - A test should never be flaky
  - Try to avoid mocking things whenever possible.
  - Test coverage is not a metric for what was tested; it‚Äôs a metric for what code your tests managed to hit
  - The code should be easy to test \* Make your test code succinct and idiomatic
- [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) is a test framework. It's very elegant and allows to quickly write very maintainable tests.
- [My Python testing style guide](https://blog.thea.codes/my-python-testing-style-guide/)
  - Assert results and outcome, not the steps needed to get there
  - Use real objects for collaborators whenever possible
  - A mock must always have a spec
  - Consider using a stub or fake
  - Consider using a spy
  - Don't give mock/stubs/fakes special names
  - Use factory helpers to create complex collaborators
  - Use fixtures sparingly
